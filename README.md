#### What's going on?

This GitBook will serve as a complete repository of all my notes, research and tools that I use. Walkthroughs and write-ups for CTF exercises and hands-on labs will also be posted here. These will be filed under [TryHackMe](tryhackme/) and [HackTheBox](hackthebox/).

Notes, information and guides on general systems administration will also be added here, although maybe less frequently. Deployment guides for applications on [Intune](intune/) will be filed under [App Deployments](intune/app-deployment.md).

#### More stuff!
