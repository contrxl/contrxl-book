# Communication Protocols

### Why Protocols Matter

Computers use rules (protocols) to communicate. In a wired or wireless environment, a local network is defined as an area where all hosts must "speak the same language" e.g. share a common protocol. Network protocols define many aspects of communication, these are listed below:

| Protocol Characteristic | Description                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Message Format          | Specific format/structure must be used. Format depends on type of message and channel used.                                                         |
| Message Size            | Rules covering message size are very strict and can vary based on channel. Long messages may need to be broken into smaller pieces.                 |
| Timing                  | Determines the speed at which bits are transmitted across the network.                                                                              |
| Encoding                | Each bit is encoded depending on the media it is transmitted on, the destination receives and decodes the signals to interpret the message.         |
| Encapsulation           | Each message includes a header that contains addressing information, this is the process of adding the info to the pieces that make up the message. |
| Message Pattern         | Some messages require an acknowledgement before the next can be sent.                                                                               |
