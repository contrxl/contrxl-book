# The Internet Protocol

### Purpose of IPv4 Addressing

IPv4 address is a logical network address to identify a particular host. The address is assigned to the network interface connection for a host, this is normally a Network Interface Card (NIC). Every packet sent across the internet has a source and destination IPv4 address.

IPv4 address are 32 bits in length. An IPv4 address in binary format would appear like so: **11010001101001011100100000000001**. This is very hard to read, and so, the 32 bits are grouped into 8-bit bytes (octets) like this: **11010001.10100101.11001000.00000001**. This can then be converted into dotted decimal representation: **209.165.200.1**.

### IPv4 Address Structure

Logical IPv4 addresses are hierarchical and made up of two parts; network and host. The network portion of address 192.168.5.11 is **192.168.5** and the host portion is the **.11**. Routers only need to know the network portion of the address in order to send packets to the correct hosts.&#x20;
