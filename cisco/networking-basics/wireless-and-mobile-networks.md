# Wireless and Mobile Networks

### Smartphone Connections

Smartphones connect to wireless networks in many ways:

* Global Positioning System (GPS) : smartphone can receive signals from satellites around the world.
* WiFi : receivers in the phone enable connection to LANs and the itnernet. The phone needs to be in range of the WiFi AP to connect.
* Bluetooth : low-power, short range wireless technology intended for speakers, headphones or watches.
* Near Field Communication (NFC) : allows data exchange between devices in close proximity. NFC uses electromagnetic fields to transmit data.

### Mobile Device Connectivity

Almost all mobile devices can connect to WiFi networks, connecting to WiFi should be done where possible to avoid cellular data charges and to conserve battery (WiFi radios use less power than cellular radios). Precautions should be taken when using WiFi communication on a mobile device:

* Don't send login or password info in plaintext
* Always use a VPN
* Enable home network security
* Use WPA2 or higher for security

### Bluetooth

When a Bluetooth device is set to discoverable mode, it transmits: name, bluetooth class, services the device can use, and technical information like the features or Bluetooth specification it uses. During pairing, a PIN may be requested, this is usually a number but can be a passkey. The PIN is stored after pairing so this only needs to be entered once.
