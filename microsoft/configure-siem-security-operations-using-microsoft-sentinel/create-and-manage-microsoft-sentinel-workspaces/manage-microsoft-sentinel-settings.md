# Manage Microsoft Sentinel Settings

Settings for the Microsoft Sentinel Environment are managed in two areas: in Microsoft Sentinel and in the Log Analytics Workspace where Microsoft Sentinel resides. In Microsoft Sentinel, the left navigation pane has a "Settings" option. Most Microsoft Sentinel settings are managed in the Log Analytics Workspace.

### Configure Log Retention

Data retention can be configured from 30 to 730 days for all workspaces (unless they are using the legacy Free Pricing tier). To adjust retention: select settings from the Microsoft Sentinel Settings area, select "Usage and estimated costs" tab, and then select "Retention" to open a blade which allows for customisation of retention days.
