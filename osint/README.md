# ðŸ’¡ OSINT

Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is the methodology used for collecting, analysing and making decisions about publicly available data sources which will be used in an intelligence context.&#x20;

The term "Open" here refers to publicly available sources, any information that is available to the general public can be considered OSINT.

The [OSINT Framework](https://osintframework.com/) is focused on gathering information from free tools or resources and provides a vast collection of links in an easy to understand format.
