# âš’ Tools

A growing list of tools & utilities to help with a wide range of tasks. Basic or web based tools will be listed on this main page, whilst more in-depth explanations of more unique tools will get their own sub-page.

* [AppDevTools](https://appdevtools.com/) : extensive list of useful developer tools.
* [arp-scan](https://www.kali.org/tools/arp-scan/) : local network scanner.
* [Bettercap](https://www.bettercap.org/) : swiss-army knife for WiFi hacking and MITM attacks.
* [Crackstation](https://crackstation.net/) : online password hash cracking tool.
* [Ettercap](https://www.ettercap-project.org/) : suite which assists in performing MITM attacks.
* [FlareVM](https://github.com/mandiant/flare-vm) : a pre-built reverse engineering environment designed to be installed on a Windows VM, installation instructions can be found on [Mandiant](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/flarevm-open-to-public).
* [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) : curated list of exploitable Unix binaries.
* [Oracle VM Virtual BOX ](https://www.virtualbox.org/): my preferred VM software, has most features that [VMWare Workstation](https://www.vmware.com/uk/products/workstation-player.html) requires payment for. A little harder to setup.
* [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists) : huge collection of helpful wordlists for pentesting and vulnerability testing.
* [SRIHash](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/) : anti-tamper tool for generating URL hashes.
* [WinDirStat](https://windirstat.net/) : disk usage statistic viewer for Windows, very handy.
