# Terminology

* AI Interceptor: an AI set up and trained on malicious inputs which checks user messages before they are passed to a chatbot. The more the chatbot is attacked, the better the interceptor becomes.
* Natural Language Processing (NLP): a part of AI dedicated to allowing computers to understand and respond to human language. Core part of this is having the computer predict the next word in a sequence based on context provided.
* Prompt Injection: manipulation of a chatbots responses by providing specific queries, tricking it into giving unexpected responses. Attacks can potentially extract sensitive info or force the bot to provide misleading responses.
