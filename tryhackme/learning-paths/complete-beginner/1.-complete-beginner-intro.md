# Complete Beginner Intro

### Research

Research is an important part of pentesting. Google is a valuable tool as is ExploitDB and others found in [Vulnerability OSINT](../../../osint/vulnerability-osint.md). Kali has a built-in command to search ExploitDB - searchsploit.

In-built Linux "man" command is very useful for finding syntax of commands e.g. man ssh will output all the info for the ssh command. Can use grep with man to find specific switches e.g. man ssh | grep -e "version number" will search for the string "version number" in the ssh man page.
