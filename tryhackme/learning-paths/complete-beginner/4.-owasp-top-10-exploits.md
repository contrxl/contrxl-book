# 4. OWASP Top 10 Exploits

### Introduction

The top ten being exploited & investigated here are:

1. Broken Access Control
2. Cryptographic Failure
3. Injection
4. Insecure Design
5. Security Misconfiguration
6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components
7. Identification and Authentication Failures
8. Software and Data Integrity Failures
9. Security Logging & Monitoring Failures
10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

### Broken Access Control

Websites have pages protected from regular visitors, for example, only the sites admin user should be able to access a page to manage other users. If a website visitor can access pages they are not supposed to, then access control is broken.&#x20;

If a regular visitor can acces protected pages it can lead to them viewing sensitive information from otther users or accessing unauthroised functionality. An example of this is a [vulnerability from 2019](https://bugs.xdavidhu.me/google/2021/01/11/stealing-your-private-videos-one-frame-at-a-time/) where an attacker could retrieve frames from YouTube videos marked as private.

Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) is an access control vulnerability where you can access resources you wouldn't normally be able to see. For example, if you were logging into a bank account and receive the URL "https://bank.thm/account?id=111111" you can try to change the "?id=111111" to another, you could assume "?id=222222" is another users account, if incorrectly configured, this would allow you access.

### Cryptographic Failure

A cryptographic failure is a vulnerability that arises for misuse (or lack of use) of cryptographic algorithms for protecting sensitive information. For example, in a secure email application you want to make sure that when you are accessing your email account in browser that your emails are encrypted. This way, any eavesdroppers won't be able to recover data from captured packets. This is known as encrypting data in transit. It is also desirable to ensure the email provider cannot read your emails when stored, this is referred to as encrypting at rest.

These often result in web apps accidentally divulging sensitive data, this data is often directly linked to customers like names and DoBs, but could contain more sensitive info like passwords.&#x20;
