# 7. Cryptography - Encryption

### Introduction

Some common terms to know before continuing are:

* Ciphertext : result of encrypting plaintext.
* Cipher : method of encrypting or decrypting data, modern ciphers are cryptographic but not all are.
* Plaintext : data before encryption, commonly text but can be a file or image.
* Encryption : transforming plaintext to ciphertext using a cipher.
* Encoding : not encryption but form of data representation like base64, immediately reversible.
* Key : info needed to correct decrypt ciphertext to plaintext.
* Passphrase : like a password, used to protect a key.
* Asymmetric encryption : different keys to encrypt and decrypt.
* Symmetric encryption : same key to encrypt an decrypt.
* Brute force : attacking cryptography by trying every password or key.
* Cryptanalysis : attacking cryptography by finding flaws in the maths.
* Alice and Bob : used to represent two people who want to communicate, used because it gives initials A and B.
