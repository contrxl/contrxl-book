# Network Exploitation Basics

### The OSI Model

The OSI model consists of seven layers:

Layer 7 - Application: provides networking options to programs that run on a computer. Works almost exclusively with applications, providing an interface for them to use transmit data, the application layer passes information down to the presentation layer.

Layer 6 - Presentation: receives data from the app layer, data is normally in a format the app understands but needs to be undrestood by receiving computer. This layer translates the data into a standard format and encrypts, compresses or handles other transformations before passing the data to the session layer.

Layer 5 - Session: looks to see if a connection can be made with the other computer upon receiving the data. If it cannot, it returns and error and the process stops. If it can then the session layer will maintain the connection and cooperate with the session layer of the remote computer to synchronise communication. Session layer sessions are unique to the communication in question, allowing multiple requests to be made to different endpoints simultaneously. Once a connection is successfully logged, the data is passed down to the transport layer,

Layer 4 - Transport: serves numerous functions. First, it decides which protocol to use, the two most common are TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol). TCP is a connection based protocol, meaning a connection is made and maintained for the duration of the request. This allows constant communication and ensures any lost data is resent. UDP does not resend lost data, normally used for video transmission where lost packets can't be resent.  TCP is for accuracy over speed. Once protocol is selected, the transport layer divides the transmission into segments (TCP) or datagrams (UDP).

Layer 3 - Network: responsible for locating destination of request. Network layer takes the IP and identifies the best route to take. This works with logical addresses which are software controlled, these provide order to networks. The most common form of logical addressing is IPv4 or IPv6.

Layer 2 - Data Link: focuses on physical addressing. Packet from network layer include the IP address and this adds the MAC address of the receiving endpoint. Every network enabled computer contains an NIC (Network Interface Card) which comes with a unique MAC (Media Access Control) address. This address is set by the manufacturer and cannot be changed (but can be spoofed!). Data link is also responsible for formatting data suitable for transmission, additionally, this layer checks the info hasn't been corrupted during transmission.

Layer 1 - Physical: hardware of the computer, converts binary data to signals and transmits them across the network as well as converts signals received back to binary data.
