# Governance and Regulation

#### Terminology

**Governance:** managing and directing an organisation or system to achieve its objectives and ensure compliance within laws, regulations and standards.

**Regulation:** a rule or law enforced by a governing body to ensure compliance and protect against harm.

**Compliance:** the state of adhering to laws, regulations and standards that apply to an organisation or system.

#### Information Security Governance

This is an organisation's established structure, policies, method and guidelines designed to ensure privacy, reliability and accessibility of information assets. This falls under the purview of top-tier management and includes the following processes:

* **Strategy:** development and implementation of a comprehensive security strategy that aligns with the business's objectives.
* **Policies and Procedures:** preparing policies & procedures which govern the use and protection of information assets and implement risk mitigation measures.
* **Risk Management:** conducting risk assessments to identify potential threats to the organisation's information assets and implement risk mitigation measures.
* **Performance Measurement:** establishing metrics and KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) to measure effectiveness of the governance.
* **Compliance:** ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and industry best practices.

#### Information Security Regulation

Regulation refers to legal and regulatory frameworks which govern the use and protection of information assets. Compliance with regulations is typically mandatory and enforced by the government or other regulatory bodies. Examples of information security regulations are GDPR, PCI DSS, Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) and more. The benefits of implementing proper governance and regulation are as follows:

* **More Robust Security Posture:** help reduce the risk of security breaches and protect sensitive information from unauthorised access, theft and misuse.
* **Increased Stakeholder Confidence:** enhance stakeholder trust by demonstrating that an organisation takes cyber security seriously.
* **Regulatory Compliance:** can help avoid legal and financial penalties and reputational damage resulting from non-compliance.
* **Alignment with Business Objectives:** ensure security measures are cost effective and contribute to the organisation's success.
* **Competitive Advantage:** can provide an advantage by demonstrating trust and commitment to protecting sensitive data.

#### Information Security Frameworks

A security framework provides a comprehensive set of documents which outline the organisation's approach to information security. This includes:

* **Policies:** formal statement outline an organisation's goals, principles, and guidelines for achieving specific objectives.
* **Standards:** a document establishing specific requiremetns or specifications for a particular process, product or service.
* **Guidelines:** document providing recommendations and best practices for achieving goals or objectives.
* **Procedures:** set of steps for undertaking a particular task or process.
* **Basleines:** minimum security standards or requirements that an organisation or system must meet.

Some general steps used to develop policies, standards, guidelines etc. are:

* **Identify Scope & Purpose:** determine what the document will cover and why it is needed.
* **Research & Review:** research relevant laws, industry standards, regulations and best practices to ensure your document is comprehensive.
* **Draft Document:** develop an outline and draft the document, following best practices. Ensure the document is specific, actionable and aligned with the organisations goals and values.
* **Review & Approval:** have document reviewed by stakeholders like subject matter experts, legal & compliance teams, and senior management. Take their feedback and ensure the document aligns with organisational goals and values.
* **Implementation & Communication:** communicate document to relevant employees and stakeholders, develop training and awareness programs to ensure the document is understood.
* **Review & Update:** periodically review and update the document to ensure it is relevant and practical.

#### Governance Risk and Compliance (GRC)

A GRC framework focuses on steering the organisation's overall governance, enterprise risk management, and compliance in an integrated manner. A GRC framework has the following components:

* **Governance Component:** involves guiding an organisation by setting security strategy, policy, standards, baselines, frameworks etc. as well as establishing appropriate monitoring methods.
* **Risk Management Component:** identify, assess, and prioritise risks to the organisation and implementing controls and mitigations to manage those risks. Includes monitoring and reporting on risks and continuous evaluation.
* **Compliance Component:** ensuring the organisation meets legal, regulatory and industry obligations. This includes developing and implementing compliance programs, conducing regular audits and reporting compliance issues to stakeholders.

Some generic guidelines for developing a GRC are:

* **Define Scope & Objectives:** determine scope of GRC program and define its goals. For example, an objective might be to reduce cyber risks to 50% in the next 12 months and maintain customer trust.
* **Conduct a Risk Assessment:** identify and assess cyber risks, risks should be prioritised and a strategy developed.
* **Develop Policies & Procedures:** implement logging, monitoring or password policies.
* **Establish Governance Processes:** ensure the GRC is effectively managed and controlled, potentially establish a steering committee to review.
* **Implement Controls:** techical and non-technical controls are implemented to mitigate risks. For example, implementation of firewalls, IPS, IDS, and SIEM (Security Information Even Management).
* **Monitor and Measure Performance:** organisation should track metrics and compliance with security policies. This can be used to identify areas for improvement.
* **Continously Improve:** the GRC program is constantly reviewed and improved based on performance metrics, changing risk profiles and stakeholder feedback.
