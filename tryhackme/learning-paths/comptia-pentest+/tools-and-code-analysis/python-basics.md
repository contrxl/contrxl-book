# Python Basics

### Mathematical Operators

| Operator       | Syntax | Example    |
| -------------- | ------ | ---------- |
| Addition       | +      | 1+1=2      |
| Subtraction    | -      | 5-1=4      |
| Multiplication | \*     | 10\*10=100 |
| Division       | /      | 10/2=5     |
| Modulus        | %      | 10%2=0     |
| Exponent       | \*\*   | 5\*\*2=25  |

### Comparison Operators

| Symbol                   | Syntax |
| ------------------------ | ------ |
| Greater Than             | >      |
| Less Than                | <      |
| Equal To                 | ==     |
| Not Equal To             | !=     |
| Greater Than or Equal To | >=     |
| Less Than or Equal To    | <=     |

### Data Types

* String: combinations of characters like letters or symbols.
* Integer: whole numbers.
* Float: numbers with decimal points or fractions.
* Boolean: data restricted to True or False.
* List: series of different data types in a collection.

### Logical Operators

| Logical Operation        | Operator | Example   |
| ------------------------ | -------- | --------- |
| Equivalence              | ==       | if x == 5 |
| Less Than                | <        | if x < 5  |
| Less Than or Equal To    | <=       | if x <= 5 |
| Greater Than             | >        | if x > 5  |
| Greater Than or Equal To | >=       | if x >= 5 |

### Boolean Operators

| Boolean Operation                                          | Operator | Example                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Both conditions must be true for the statement to be true. | AND      | <p>if x>=5 AND x&#x3C;=100<br>True if x is between 5 and 100</p> |
| Only one condition of the statement needs to be true.      | OR       | <p>if x==1 OR x==10<br>True if x is 1 or 10</p>                  |
| If a condition is the opposite of an argument.             | NOT      | <p>if NOT y<br>Returns True if y is False</p>                    |
